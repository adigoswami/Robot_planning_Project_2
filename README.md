Here in these codes pygame has been used.
Therefore you should have pygame installed on your system.

NOTE:- In both the codes, 'r = 2' is the resolution/discretisation value.
For good performance it has been set to '2'.
For better resolution you may set it to '1' but it makes the program run slower.
